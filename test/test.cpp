*
* @section DESCRIPTION
*
* This is a test for ControllerPID class and its methods.
* 
* Test cases:
* 
* Test case 1 tests the compute method by returning a double value which
* is pre-calculated. Ideally, after the changes are done in the computeVelocity
* method, this test should pass.
* 
* Test case 2 tests the correct initialization of sampling_time. This test
* passes even before doing any changes.
