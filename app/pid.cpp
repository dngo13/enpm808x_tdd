* This method computes the new velocity using current and reference velocities as inputs
* This is stub implementation of the method computeVelocity which returns a constant value.
* To do by part 2: 
* We need to add the PID computations inside of this method in order for the test cases to pass.
* 
* @param1 set_point         This is the target/desired velocity which needs to be achieved.
*                           This parameter will be taken from the user as input.
* 
* @param2 current_velocity  This is the current/actual velocity.

* @return new_velocity
